# Visualization-of-shortest-Path-Finding-Algorithm
  Implementation of Breadth First Search to find the shortest path between given source and destination. 

  Simple mini project to find the shortest path between given source and destination using breadth first search algorithm.

   Prerequisites: 
   1.Implementing queue with linked list.
   2.BFS Algorithm 
   3.Basic of OpenGL C Version.
   
   Overview:
   1.Code has been implemented in C language. 
   2.Map drawn with the help of grid.(in my case its my campus(IIEST) )
   3.Color has been given with the help of OpenGl in C version.
